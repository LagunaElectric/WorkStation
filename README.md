# Editor
### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), also known as VS Code, is a code editor for Linux, Windows, and macOS. It is a well know editor that I have used it for about 1 year and it is great! I have some extension installed in it that makes my workflow more simpler, wanna know what extensions I use? see below!
- ### Extensions
    - UI Theme- This includes some of the popular theme extensions listed below:
        - [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda)- Dark Theme with a taste of the universe
