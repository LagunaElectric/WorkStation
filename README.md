# Tools

## What am I covering in this? 
    1. Code Editor that I use for my work
    2. My Terminal setup and how I build it 
    3. Music that I listen while work


# Editor
### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), also known as VS Code, is a code editor for Linux, Windows, and macOS. It is a well know editor that I have used it for about 1 year and it is great! I have some extension installed in it that makes my workflow more simpler, wanna know what extensions I use? see below!
- ### Extensions
    - UI Theme- This includes some of the popular theme extensions listed below:
        - [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda)- Dark Theme with a taste of the universe
        ![Andomeda Theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Andromeda/raw/master/images/andromeda.png)
        - [Gruvbox Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sainnhe.gruvbox-material)- Gruvbox with Material Palette

    - File Icon theme- This includes some of the popular Icon theme extensions list below:
        - [Helium Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=helgardrichard.helium-icon-theme)- Helium and Material Design Icons for Visual Studio Code
    - Metting & Code sharing Purposes- Sometime I have to share my code with the team I am working with, the Live Share comes to save me at that place:
        - [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)- Built by Microsoft
    - Last but not the least, Music Extension
        - [Music Time for Spotify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.music-time)- This helps me to code peacefully and helps me to fix bugs easily üòõ


# Terminal

- ## Terminal Utilities
    - [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)- Neofetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.
    - [Jet Brains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#how-to-install)- Free and open source typeface designed for developers,
    I downloaded the font from the JetBrains website and installed it in Windows.
    - [Atom One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) I really like the Atom One Dark theme (I also use the same theme in VSCode), so I‚Äôve added that as a new colour scheme in my `setting.json` file 
- ## Linux command line on windows or macOS (`WSL`)
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux (`WSL2`) has really changed the game when it comes to open source development on Windows, I have benefitted from years of developer workflow improvements and enhancements at the command line but now I can bring those into Windows.
    
    - Lets Talk About `WSL2`  now?
        - It gives me he ability to run Linux containers, benefiting from the improved filesystem performance, from within Windows Isn't that pleasant to hear?, Well yes!
    
    - [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)- I use zsh as my preferred shell and oh my zsh to help manage my zsh configuration
        - oh-my-zsh plugins
            - `git`- This comes bundled as part of the oh-my-zsh install. No need to install it then!
            - `zsh-syntax-highlighting`- I use this plugin to enable highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at the command line
            - zsh-autosuggestions- As the name suggests, provides me type completions based on my previous command execution history


    - [Spaceship ZSH](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/)- It makes my prompt looks nice and provides extensions that helps improve my workflow
